    <h1>Notes for Chapter 2 Programming Basics</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Single Line comments start with //</li>
            <li>Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */</li>
            <li>Use <span class="word">typeof</span> for finding out the type of a value. <span
                    class="examples">Ex...typeof 'hello'...returns....'string'</span></li>
            <li><span class="word">const</span> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value</li>
            <li><span class="word">let</span> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program</li>
            <li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have<span class="word">global scope</span>. This
                means it is accessible everywhere in the program. </li>
            <li>blocks can be used to create a <span class="word">local scope</span>. This means that any variables
                defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be
                accessible outside of that block</li>
            <li>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar
                character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.<span
                    class="examples">Examples....$name, _answer, firstName, last_name, address_line1</span></li>
            <li>Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods, so it's best
                to not follow this convention for your own variable names. The $ character is also used by the popular
                jQuery library, so using this in your variable names may also cause problems.</li>
            <li>Constant and variable names are case sensitive</li>
            <li><span class="examples">'It's me'</span> // causes an error
                <span class="examples">"It’s me"</span> // this works Another option is to escape the quotation mark
                <span class="examples">'It\'s me'</span></li>
            <li>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:

                Single quote marks \'

                Double quote marks \"

                End of line \n

                Carriage return \r

                Tab \t

                If you want to actually write a backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash:

                "This is a backslash \\"
                ..... "This is a backslash \"</li>
            <li>we can write a string in all capital letters using the <span class="word">toUpperCase()</span> method
            </li>
            <li> the <span class="word">toLowerCase()</span> method, which will write my name in all lower-case letters
            </li>
            <li>If you want to know which character is at a certain position, you can use the <span
                    class="word">charAt()</span> method</li>
            <li>If you want to find where a certain character or substring appears in a string, we can use the <span
                    class="word">indexOf()</span> method</li>
            <li>If we want the last occurrence of a character or substring, we can use the <span
                    class="word">lastIndexOf()</span> method</li>
            <li>If all we want to know if a string contains a certain character, then ES2016 provides the useful <span
                    class="word">includes()</span> method</li>
            <li>To check if a string starts with a certain character, we can use the <span
                    class="word">startsWith()</span> method. Be careful though, it's case-sensitive</li>
            <li>And we can use the similar <span class="word">endsWith() </span>method to check if a string ends with a
                particular character</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">concat()</span> method can be used to concatenate two or more strings together or
                the <span class="word">+</span></li>
            <li>The <span class="word">trim()</span> method will remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of a
                string</li>
            <li> the <span class="word">repeat()</span> method that will repeat a string the stated number of times:
            </li>
            <li><span class="word">Template literals</span> are a special types of string that were introduced in ES6.
                Template literals use the backtick character, <span class="word">`</span> , to deliminate the string, as
                shown in the example below:<span class="examples">`She said, "It's Me!"` or `Hello!`; or const age = 39;
                    `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;
                    << 'I will be 40 next year' </span> </li> <li>The <span class="word">toFixed()</span> method rounds
                        a number to a fixed number of decimal places: <span class="examples">Examples: PI.toFixed(3); //
                            only one dot is needed when using constants or variables
                            << "3.142" </span> </li> <li>There is also a useful function called <span
                                    class="word">parseInt()</span> that can be used to convert a string representation
                                of a numerical value back into a number</li>
            <li>if you use parseInt with a decimal, it will remove anything after the decimal point</li>
            <li><span class="word">parseFloat()</span> that converts strings into floating point decimal numbers</li>
            <li><span class="word">Undefined</span> is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a value.
            </li>
            <li><span class="word">Null</span> means 'no value'. It can be thought of as a placeholder that JavaScript
                uses to say "there should be a value here, but there isn’t at the moment."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>Notes for Chapter 3: Arrays Logic and Loops</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="word">array constructor function</span><span class="examples">  Example:  const myArray = new Array();
                << []</span></li>
            <li>If an element in an array is empty, undefined is returned</li>
            <li>You don’t even have to use the same types of items inside an array</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">delete</span> operator will remove an item from an array</li>
            <li> we have to subtract 1 from the <span class="word">length</span> property. This is because the index starts at 0, so the last item in the array will have an index of one less than the array’s length.</li>
            <li>if you make the array longer, the extra slots will be filled in with <span class="word">undefined</span></li>
            <li>To remove the last item from an array, we can use the <span class="word">pop()</span> method:</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">shift()</span> method works in a similar way to the pop() method, but this removes thefirstitem in the array</li>
            <li>The  <span class="word">push()</span> method appends a new value to the end of the array.</li>
            <li>The<span class="word"> unshift()</span> method is similar to the push() method, but this appends a new item to thebeginningof the array</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">concat()</span> method can be used to merge an array with one or more arrays</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">join()</span> method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas: <span class="examples">Examples: avengers.join();
                << 'Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow' -------OR------ avengers.join(' & ');
                << 'Captain America & Iron Man & Thor & Hulk & Hawkeye & Black Widow'</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="word">set </span>is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values</li>
            <li>A <span class="word">memory leak</span> occurs when a program retains references to values that can no longer be accessed in its memory. This means that memory is being used to store values that are no longer required by the program, effectively wasting system resources.</li>
            <li><span class="word">Maps</span> were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
