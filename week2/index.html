    <h1>Notes for Chapter 2 Programming Basics</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Single Line comments start with //</li>
            <li>Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */</li>
            <li>Use <span class="word">typeof</span> for finding out the type of a value. <span
                    class="examples">Ex...typeof 'hello'...returns....'string'</span></li>
            <li><span class="word">const</span> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value</li>
            <li><span class="word">let</span> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program</li>
            <li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have<span class="word">global scope</span>. This
                means it is accessible everywhere in the program. </li>
            <li>blocks can be used to create a <span class="word">local scope</span>. This means that any variables
                defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be
                accessible outside of that block</li>
            <li>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar
                character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.<span
                    class="examples">Examples....$name, _answer, firstName, last_name, address_line1</span></li>
            <li>Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods, so it's best
                to not follow this convention for your own variable names. The $ character is also used by the popular
                jQuery library, so using this in your variable names may also cause problems.</li>
            <li>Constant and variable names are case sensitive</li>
            <li><span class="examples">'It's me'</span> // causes an error
                <span class="examples">"It’s me"</span> // this works Another option is to escape the quotation mark
                <span class="examples">'It\'s me'</span></li>
            <li>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:

                Single quote marks \'

                Double quote marks \"

                End of line \n

                Carriage return \r

                Tab \t

                If you want to actually write a backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash:

                "This is a backslash \\"
                ..... "This is a backslash \"</li>
            <li>we can write a string in all capital letters using the <span class="word">toUpperCase()</span> method
            </li>
            <li> the <span class="word">toLowerCase()</span> method, which will write my name in all lower-case letters
            </li>
            <li>If you want to know which character is at a certain position, you can use the <span
                    class="word">charAt()</span> method</li>
            <li>If you want to find where a certain character or substring appears in a string, we can use the <span
                    class="word">indexOf()</span> method</li>
            <li>If we want the last occurrence of a character or substring, we can use the <span
                    class="word">lastIndexOf()</span> method</li>
            <li>If all we want to know if a string contains a certain character, then ES2016 provides the useful <span
                    class="word">includes()</span> method</li>
            <li>To check if a string starts with a certain character, we can use the <span
                    class="word">startsWith()</span> method. Be careful though, it's case-sensitive</li>
            <li>And we can use the similar <span class="word">endsWith() </span>method to check if a string ends with a
                particular character</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">concat()</span> method can be used to concatenate two or more strings together or
                the <span class="word">+</span></li>
            <li>The <span class="word">trim()</span> method will remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of a
                string</li>
            <li> the <span class="word">repeat()</span> method that will repeat a string the stated number of times:
            </li>
            <li><span class="word">Template literals</span> are a special types of string that were introduced in ES6.
                Template literals use the backtick character, <span class="word">`</span> , to deliminate the string, as
                shown in the example below:<span class="examples">`She said, "It's Me!"` or `Hello!`; or const age = 39;
                    `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;
                    << 'I will be 40 next year' </span> </li> <li>The <span class="word">toFixed()</span> method rounds
                        a number to a fixed number of decimal places: <span class="examples">Examples: PI.toFixed(3); //
                            only one dot is needed when using constants or variables
                            << "3.142" </span> </li> <li>There is also a useful function called <span
                                    class="word">parseInt()</span> that can be used to convert a string representation
                                of a numerical value back into a number</li>
            <li>if you use parseInt with a decimal, it will remove anything after the decimal point</li>
            <li><span class="word">parseFloat()</span> that converts strings into floating point decimal numbers</li>
            <li><span class="word">Undefined</span> is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a value.
            </li>
            <li><span class="word">Null</span> means 'no value'. It can be thought of as a placeholder that JavaScript
                uses to say "there should be a value here, but there isn’t at the moment."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>Notes for Chapter 3: Arrays Logic and Loops</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="word">array constructor function</span><span class="examples"> Example: const myArray = new
                    Array();
                    << []</span> </li> <li>If an element in an array is empty, undefined is returned</li>
            <li>You don’t even have to use the same types of items inside an array</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">delete</span> operator will remove an item from an array</li>
            <li> we have to subtract 1 from the <span class="word">length</span> property. This is because the index
                starts at 0, so the last item in the array will have an index of one less than the array’s length.</li>
            <li>if you make the array longer, the extra slots will be filled in with <span class="word">undefined</span>
            </li>
            <li>To remove the last item from an array, we can use the <span class="word">pop()</span> method:</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">shift()</span> method works in a similar way to the pop() method, but this
                removes thefirstitem in the array</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">push()</span> method appends a new value to the end of the array.</li>
            <li>The<span class="word"> unshift()</span> method is similar to the push() method, but this appends a new
                item to thebeginningof the array</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">concat()</span> method can be used to merge an array with one or more arrays</li>
            <li>The <span class="word">join()</span> method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises
                all the items in the array, separated by commas: <span class="examples">Examples: avengers.join();
                    << 'Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow' -------OR------ avengers.join(' & ');
                << ' Captain America & Iron Man & Thor & Hulk & Hawkeye & Black Widow'</span> </li> <li>A <span
                            class="word">set </span>is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values,
                        so it cannot include any duplicate values</li>
            <li>A <span class="word">memory leak</span> occurs when a program retains references to values that can no
                longer be accessed in its memory. This means that memory is being used to store values that are no
                longer required by the program, effectively wasting system resources.</li>
            <li><span class="word">Maps</span> were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are
                a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables'
                or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.</li>
            <li>A shorthand way of writing an if ... else statement is to use the ternary operator, <span
                    class="word">?</span>, which takes three operands in the following format: <span class="examples">
                    console.log(`n is a ${(n%2 === 0)? 'even' : 'odd'} number`);</span></li>
            <li><span class="examples">switch (number) {
                    case 4:
                    console.log('You rolled a four');
                    break;
                    case 5:
                    console.log('You rolled a five');
                    break;
                    case 6:
                    console.log('You rolled a six');
                    break;
                    default:
                    console.log('You rolled a number less than four');
                    break;</span>}</li>
            <li>a ninja programmer always finishes a case block with a break !</li>
            <li>You can place a loop inside another loop to create a <span class="word">nested loop</span>. It will have
                an inner loop that will run all the way through before the next step of the outer loop occurs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>Notes for Chapter 4: Functions</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Another way of defining a function literal is to create a <span class="word">function expression</span>.
                This assigns ananonymous functionto a variable: <span class="examples">const goodbye = function(){
                    console.log('Goodbye World!');-------OR------ const goodbye = function bye(){console.log('Goodbye
                    World!');}; };</span></li>
            <li>A function can also be declared using the <span class="word">constructor Function()</span> . The body of
                the function is entered as a string, as shown in this example: <span class="examples">const hi = new
                    Function('console.log("Hi World!");');</span></li>
            <li>Don’t Repeat Yourself, or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a program
                should only be written once. This avoids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces
                of code up to date and in sync.</li>
            <li> you need parentheses to invoke a function</li>
            <li>All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes after the
                <span class="word">return</span> keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return anything (such as
                all the examples we have seen so far) will return undefined by default.</li>
            <li><span class="word">Parameters and arguments</span> are terms that are often used interchangeably to
                represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any
                parameters a function needs are set when the function isdefined. When a function isinvoked, it is
                provided with arguments.</li>
            <li>If too many arguments are provided when a function is invoked, the function will work as normal and the
                extra arguments will be ignored</li>
            <li><span class="word">rest operator</span> can be used to deal with multiple arguments by creating an array
                of arguments that are available inside the body of the function.To use the rest operator, simply place
                three dots in front of the last parameter in a function declaration. This will then collect all the
                arguments entered into an array</li>
            <li>Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their name. The parameters
                come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always
                anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable. For example, the square
                function we wrote earlier can be written like so <span class="examples">const square = x => x*x;</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="word">Hoisting</span> is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and
                function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined.</li>
            <li>functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument
                to another is known as a <span class="word">callback</span></li>
            <li><span class="word">the forEach() method</span>. This will loop through the array and invoke a callback
                function using each value as an argument. The callback function takes three parameters, the first
                represents the value in the array, the second represents the current index and the third represent the
                array that the callback is being called on.</li>
        </ul>
